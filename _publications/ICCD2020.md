## Abstract

Prefetching techniques have been studied for decades. However, there are few studies on how concurrent memory accesses may affect prefetching effectiveness. When there are multiple concurrent memory requests, we can classify them into sub-classes by analyzing the overlapping relationship. In this work, we first propose pure prefetch coverage (PPC), a novel prefetching metric that can identify an accurate prefetch coverage under the concurrent memory access model. Then we propose APAC, an adaptive prefetch framework with PPC metric that can capture the dynamics of applications and adjust the prefetching aggressiveness. Our experimental results show that the PPC metric has a higher IPC correlation compared to the conventional prefetch coverage (PC) metric. For memory-intensive single-thread benchmarks, APAC provides an average performance improvement by 17.3% and 5.9% compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive prefetch framework FDP and NST. In a multi-core system, APAC outperforms FDP and NST by 8.5% and 5.0% IPC on average, respectively.
