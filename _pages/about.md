I am a final-year PhD candidate advised by [Prof. Xian-He Sun](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~scs/sun/biography.html) and a member of [Gnosis Research Center](https://grc.iit.edu/) at Illinois Institute of Technology. I also closely work with [Dr. Rujia Wang](https://rujiawang.github.io/) (Microsoft), [Prof. Jason Liu](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/liu-jason/) (FIU).  I received my Master's degree from New York University and my Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University.

Research Interests
======
I conduct research in Computer Architecture and High-Performance Systems, focusing on:
- Memory performance modeling
- Cache/memory performance optimizations
- Data-centric design for computer architecture
- AI-assisted design for computer architecture (AI for Systems)
- Efficient algorithm-hardware co-design for AI (Syetems for AI)
