## Utilizing Concurrent Data Accesses for High-Performance Data Processing

In modern computing, data-intensive applications frequently face memory bottlenecks that arise from underutilized opportunities for concurrent data access. This research investigates innovative strategies to maximize the benefits of concurrent access in cache management, offering solutions to effectively address the "Memory Wall" problem. Each study introduces specialized frameworks, metrics, and adaptive techniques designed to optimize cache performance by leveraging data access concurrency and reducing data access latency.

## AI-Assisted Design for Performance Optimization in Computer Architecture

As modern computer systems grow in complexity and heterogeneity, traditional hardware optimization policies struggle to adapt to dynamic runtime behaviors and diverse workload demands. This research explores how AI techniques—such as reinforcement learning and lightweight perceptron models—can drive adaptive and intelligent decisions in cache and memory management, enabling systems to learn from access patterns and improve performance holistically.
