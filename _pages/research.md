## Utilizing Concurrent Data Accesses for High-Performance Data Processing

In modern computing, data-intensive applications frequently face memory bottlenecks that arise from underutilized opportunities for concurrent data access. This research investigates innovative strategies to maximize the benefits of concurrent access in cache management, offering solutions to effectively address the "Memory Wall" problem. Each study introduces specialized frameworks, metrics, and adaptive techniques designed to optimize cache performance by leveraging data access concurrency and reducing data access latency.

## Leveraging Processing-in-Memory for Data-Intensive Applications

Data-intensive applications, particularly those involving complex graph computations, face significant performance bottlenecks due to heavy data movement and irregular memory access patterns. This research explores innovative processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures to tackle these challenges, reducing the reliance on CPU and minimizing data transfer overhead. Each study introduces a unique approach to enhance graph computing efficiency through PIM by leveraging memory locality and concurrency.
